```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r load packages, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(palmerpenguins)

library(here)
```

# The data - palmerpenguins::penguins

```{r}
print(penguins)
```


# ggplot layering

Let's start by adding one layer at a time

## 1. The data

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins)

```

## 2. The aesthetics

This is what variables of that data are being use and what are they being **mapped** to

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm))
```

## 3. The geometries

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

My personal preference is to specify the aesthetics `aes()` for each geometry. For xample"

```{r, eval = FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm))

```

You can also use the pipe (%>%) to bring data into a ggplot. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm))

```

Indicating the `aes()` on each geometry makes it more natural to change `aes()` that are speciffic for each geom. For example:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species))

```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: elements **inside** the `aes()` are asociated to variables (i.e. they will change with the data). some of these aesthectic elements (e.g. colour, shape, size, etc) can be manually fixed for **all** parts of the layer. In that case, they need to go **outside** the `aes()`. 

Compare the figure above to this:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), colour = "blue")
```


## 4. The facets

Sometimes the data is too much for one panel

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species))

```

## 5. The statistics

We can let ggplot do some *stats* in the background as it plots. For example we can use `geom_smooth()` to add a *"tendline"* (remember, not a stats course!)

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm))

```

`geom_smooth()` is very powerful, and it can fit many different regression models. The default one is a *loess* model, a very flexible model. Unfortunatelly, it tends to overfit the data and get *"distracted"* by the noise.

Fortunately, as mentioned `geom_smooth()` allows us to choose the method, so we can specify that we want a traditional *liniera model* (or linear regression). Your usual `y = a + bx`

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm")

```



You can also mapp some of the aesthec elements to variables, and this can have *surprising* effects!:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species), method = "lm")

```

This is not a stats course, but this is known as athe Simpson's paradox! (a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined)


You can combine all the previous steps:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  geom_point(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_depth_mm, colour = species), method = "lm")

```

## 5.1 Boxplots

ggplot can calculate summary stats on the fly for summary plots like Box-plots

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species))
```


Following an increasinly common trend (for good reasosns!) We can add the raw data to these boxplots, highlighting the power of layering in ggplot.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species))


```

However, it is hard to see the data that way. For these cases there is a special geom, `geom_jotter()` which is a version of `geom_point()` which adds a little bit of noise to the data to allow easier visialization. The noise can be added to the x, or to the y or both. In our case, we will add it to the x only

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species), width = 0.1, height = 0)


```

Although we will be looking more in detail to all aspects related to themes and how to "pretty-up" your plot next week, we can make this plot a bit nicer by adding some transparency to the points layer with the `alpha`

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species), width = 0.1, height = 0, alpha = 0.3)

```

## 5.2 Bar plots

There are two types of geometries to deal with bar graphs in gglot" `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()` with slightly different uses, which can be a bit confusing.

The difference is in the stats that each plot uses behind the scenes.

- `geom_bar()` uses the function `stat_count()` to calculate the height of the column, so it is mainly aimed to show counts
- `geom_col()` uses the fucntion `stat_identity()` to calculate the height of the column, so its main aim is to show summary values for variables


Let's try `geom_bar()` for counts:

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(species)) # we just need to give it one variable, the one it needs to count

```

The only information it gives us is the number of penguins for each species in the dataset. Not very useful.

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) # now we do need to give it two variables

```

hummm... There is omething odd there... lets compare it to the box plot we made earlier.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species), width = 0.1, height = 0, alpha = 0.3)

```

The `stat_identity()` function used by default in `geom_col()` as it's name indicates, plots the actual value of each sample. So there is actualy one column for each penguin being plotted on top of each-other there... Not quite what we would expect.

Yo cannot directly ask `geom_col()` or `geom_bar()` to do summary statistics directly. But in ggplot there is a whole different set of elements, different from the geoms which are able to calculate summary statistics these are the `stat_` objects.

for example:


```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_summary(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g), fun = mean, geom = "bar")

```

You need to indicate the stat function it should use (e.g. mean), as well as how it should plot it (e.g as a bar)

You can use the same aproach to add error bars



```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  stat_summary(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g), fun = mean, geom = "bar") +
  stat_summary(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g), fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar")  # the "fun.data" part is a bit tricky!

```

In general, the best aproach is to calculate whatever summary syatistics you would like to plot first, and then plot them as "identity". Lets see this aproach.

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_body_mass = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot() +  # Notice the change from "%>%" to "+" when we enter the ggplot() section
  geom_col(aes(x = species, y = mean_body_mass)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = species, ymin = mean_body_mass - sd_body_mass, ymax = mean_body_mass + sd_body_mass))
  


```

## Sould you use bar charts?

In summary, bar plots, specially summary bar plots in ggplot can be a bit of a pain. But that might be a blessing in disguise. Bar charts are notoriously bad at showing what we want them to show. So perhaps the deterrent might be better in the long term



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures", "bars_vs_box_plots.png"))
```

## 6 Save plots

Lets save a plot to the environment:


```{r}

plot_1 <- penguins %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, colour = species), width = 0.1, height = 0, alpha = 0.3)

ggsave(here("figures", "plot_1.pdf"), plot_1,
       width = 190, height = 120, units = "mm")  # as a pdf

ggsave(here("figures", "plot_1.png"), plot_1,
       width = 190, height = 120, units = "mm")  # as a png


```


Always review the output file to see the final product, the *plots* panel in RStudio is an aproximation, final text size and other formatting aspects can only be seen in the saved product.
